EYE CARE+ is a progressive web application created to help reduce eye strains. We often stare at our mobile or desktop screens for a long time without blinking, this causes dry eyes and straining. The app is designed to alert at a set interval to suggest you should take a short break or flex your eye muscles. On mobile devices it is set to 5 minutes, and on desktops it is set to 20 minutes.
